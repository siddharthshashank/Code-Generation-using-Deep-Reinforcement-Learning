# Code Generation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
The utilization of programming language (PL) models, pretrained on large-scale code corpora, as a means of automating software engineering processes has demonstrated considerable potential in streamlining various code generation tasks such as code completion, code translation, and program synthesis. However, current approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning objectives borrowed from text generation, neglecting specific sequence-level features of code, including but not limited to compilability as well as syntactic and functional correctness. To address this limitation a new framework for code generation that combines pretrained PL models with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) deep reinforcement learning and employs execution feedback as the external source of knowledge into the model optimization. PPOCoder is transferable across different code generation tasks and PLs.


<b>Overview of the framework with actor and critic models</b>: The action is sampled from the policy based on the given source data $x$ (NL or PL). Then, a reward is obtained for each action to guide and control policy updates. The reward function is composed of four elements: (a) compiler feedback; (b) syntactic matching score based on ASTs; (c) semantic matching score based on DFGs; and (d) KL-divergence penalty between active policy and the reference pretrained model. 
The critic model estimates value based on the obtained reward and framework will be optimized with PPO, which takes into account both value and policy optimization.

## Environment Installation
To run the code, install the dependencies in requirements.txt.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Datasets
We finetune/evaluate models on the following major dataset benchmarks for different code generation tasks:

* **CodeSearchNet (CSN)** is available [here](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet##data-details)
* **XLCoST** is available [here](https://github.com/reddy-lab-code-research/XLCoST)
* **APPS** is available [here](https://github.com/hendrycks/apps)
* **MBPP** is available [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp)

We preprocess the data and construct input/output sequences in the same manner as outlined in the original benchmark papers. Unzip and place all benchmarks in the `data` folder.


## Run
We have created `run.sh` script to execute PPO-based PL model fine-tuning based on the compiler signal. To run the script for different code generation tasks, configure the following parameters:
